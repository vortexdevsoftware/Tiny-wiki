<p style="text-align:center">Welcome to your first TinyDocs page!</p>

Thank you for choosing TinyDocs, the user-friendly content-management-system that makes documentation effortless!

## Configuration
To configure TinyDocs to your specific preferences, modify the [configuration file](./config.ini).

You'll find the configuration to be quite self-explanatory. 

> Notice: If you haven't done so yet, set the config.ini's permission level to **700**, otherwise your config.ini will be exposed to the internet.

## Directory structure

### Special Filename: index.md
One important feature of TinyDocs is the index.md filename, it serves as the default resolution whenever you access any subdirectory without specifying a particular page.

> Hyperlinking to the index is possible, but it's better to use the actual name of the category instead of the index page for smaller links.
- ✅ example.com/
- ✅ example.com/?p=category
- ❌ example.com/?p=category:index

### Categories
If your category lacks an index file, the engine will automatically generate a custom page displaying a list of pages within that category.

The `index.md` file is masked by the name of it's parent category.

Here's an example: [?p=Category](?p=Category/index)

## Markdown
*Markdown* is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. It is widely used for formatting text on the web and is supported by many platforms and documentation tools, including TinyDocs.

With *Markdown*, you can easily create headings, lists, links, code blocks, and more, making it an excellent choice for documenting your projects and sharing information in a clear and organized manner.

In *TinyDocs* documentation, you use *Markdown* to structure your pages, add code snippets, create lists, and include links to external resources. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, *Markdown* provides a simple and intuitive way to format your content and make it visually appealing.

If you are not familiar with *Markdown*, don't worry! It's easy to learn, and there are plenty of online resources available to help you get started. Feel free to experiment and use this platform to showcase your ideas and knowledge effectively.

For some reference, here are some common Markdown syntax examples:

### Code Blocks
Looking to document code? Markdown has you covered.

Wrap multiline code in triple backticks or wrap in a single backticks for `inline code`

Examples:
### Python Example (```py)
```py
import something

def foo(x):
  print(x) 
```
### C Example (```c)
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printf("Hello World");
  return 0;
}
```
